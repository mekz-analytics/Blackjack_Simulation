After dinner at a casino, I will inevitably find myself at a table, chasing those little hits of dopamine from winning a hand, losing all sense of time. I usually do fairly well with my own playstyle but let's see if I can play more optimally. \n",

Statistically analyze these strategies by playing lots of independent blackjack games. Then determine which choice maximizes your profit. (Assume that the House plays by the usual rules.)
